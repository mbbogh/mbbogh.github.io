# nothing to see here

This is only a test page to find out how different files in different repos on [GitHub](https://github.com) are matched to my [GitHub Pages](https://mbbogh.github.io/).

- repo: mbbogh/mbbogh.github.io.git
- source: index.md

## some of my notes to get a feeling for the conversion

- [create a favicon](create_favicon.html) (github pages can't handle org-mode files) from the [org source](create_favicon.org)
- [binary files in git repo](2021/05/0943)
